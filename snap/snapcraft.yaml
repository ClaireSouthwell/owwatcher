summary: Detects when world-writable files are created in a specified directory
description: |
    This tool monitors a directory of your choosing (usually /tmp) in real
    time. If any world-writable files or directories are created in the
    monitored directory, a notification is sent via the syslog protocol to a
    syslog server of your choosing.

    This tool is not intended to detect any kind of malware or intrusion.
    Rather, it is a vulnerability research tool which alerts a researcher of
    potential symlink race or TOCTOU vulnerabilities as the researcher goes
    about their daily activities. In this way, the researcher takes a passive
    approach to discovering symlink race or TOCTOU vulnerabilities, rather than
    a more active approach (e.g. code audits.)
